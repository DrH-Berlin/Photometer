# Photometer
Materials and software for the Raspberry Pi based photometer/colorimeter

The prototype of the photometer is described at http://www.instructables.com/id/An-Inexpensive-Photometer-and-Colorimeter. There you may also find building instructions. The SVG file required to order the necessary parts for the housing can be obtained for a small fee at Ponoko. 
In addition you will need a sensor-breakout from Adafruit, one or more LEDs and some cables, plus a M2.5 and M3 screws, nuts, and washers. The device is intended to be connected via I2C with a Raspbery Pi, but you may use an Arduino as well.
